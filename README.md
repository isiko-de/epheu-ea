## Hedera made easy

Disclaimer:
The app is in a very early, not for production meant stage. Only use in Testnet. Not all functions are implemented yet. I am a UI/UX designer who tried to code this. I am not a professional developer. This project emerged from the Hedera20 Hackathon. I did not try to make it pretty yet. My focus was, getting it to work. Once all is working and stable, I will start designing it to make it pretty!
